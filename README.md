## Description
This is a Discord Clone! A discord clone that provides real-time voice/video group chat and group messaging.

## Why?
I have been using Discord since 2017, and I absolutely love it. It was created using Electron and has low-latency voice chat with a unique UI design which makes online meetings easy and fun. I don't know if it is possible to recreate the whole thing with myself alone, so I decided to give it a try. My goal is the put my skills to the test, and it turns out that I can. I rebuilt the whole app with React.js as my front-end framework, Redux as my state management system, and used Firebase and Agora for database and real-time voice/video chat.
